### Manual Installation

To build the theme the follwing packages are required 
* `autoconf`
* `automake`
* `pkg-config` or `pkgconfig` if you use Fedora
* `libgtk-3-dev` for Debian based distros or `gtk3-devel` for RPM based distros
* `git` if you want to clone the source directory

**Note:** If your distribution doesn't ship separate development packages you just need GTK 3 instead of the `-dev` packages.

For the theme to function properly, install the following
* Gnome Shell, GTK 3.14 - 3.22
* The `gnome-themes-standard` package
* The murrine engine. This has different names depending on your distro.
  * `gtk-engine-murrine` (Arch Linux)
  * `gtk2-engines-murrine` (Debian, Ubuntu, elementary OS)
  * `gtk-murrine-engine` (Fedora)
  * `gtk2-engine-murrine` (openSUSE)
  * `gtk-engines-murrine` (Gentoo)

Install the theme with the following commands

#### 1. Get the source

Clone the git repository with

    git clone https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme --depth 1 && cd arc-theme

#### 2. Build and install the theme

## Troubleshooting

If you have Ubuntu with a newer GTK/Gnome version than the one included by default (i.e Ubuntu 14.04 with GTK 3.14 or Ubuntu 15.04 with GTK 3.16, etc.) the prebuilt packages won't work properly and you have to install the theme manually as described above.
This is also true for other distros with a different GTK/Gnome version than the one included by default

If you get artifacts like black or invisible backgrounds under Unity, disable overlay scrollbars with

    gsettings set com.canonical.desktop.interface scrollbar-mode normal
